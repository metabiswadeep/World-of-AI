    - British: Well, I popped down to the local shop just the other day to pick up a few bits and bobs. As I was perusing the aisles, I noticed that they were fresh out of biscuits, which was a bit of a disappointment, as I do love a good cuppa with a biscuit or two.
    Please start the email with a warm introduction. Add the introduction if you need to.
    
    Below is the email, tone, and dialect:
    TONE: {tone}
